Project Title
Campus Bridge â€“ Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

Selected Domain
Web technology
Problem Statement / Use Case
Many students and faculty of MBU struggle to manage academic activities and skill development separately. Traditional LMS platforms lack integrated features like real-time coding environments, skill tracking, and placement tools. There's a need for a unified platform that connects academic learning, coding practice, and career readiness.

Abstract / Problem Description
Students today rely on multiple disconnected platforms for learning, coding, and placement preparation. This fragmentation leads to inefficiency, lack of motivation, and missed opportunities. Faculty members also face challenges in content distribution, student tracking, and engagement.

Campus Bridge is a unified academic and coding development platform that streamlines the entire student journey from learning to career preparation. The system offers role-based dashboards for students, faculty, and administrators, enabling users to manage lectures, assignments, progress tracking, coding practice, and placement tools in one place.

Key features include lecture material uploads, coding track management, a built-in code editor, attendance tracking, analytics dashboards, and access to external resources like job boards and interview practice tools. The platform is designed with a clean, responsive UI and leverages modern web technologies to ensure a smooth user experience.

Tech Stack Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript

Backend: Django (Python)

Database: SQLite3

Libraries & Tools:

Chart.js (for progress graphs)

JDoodle API (for code execution)

AJAX (for dynamic form rendering)

Google.Gemini API ( for ai integration)

Project Explanation
Campus Bridge is developed as a modular Django web application, featuring multiple apps for different roles and functionalities:

Users App: Handles authentication, registration (student, faculty), and dashboard routing.

LMS App: Manages subjects, chapters, materials, quizzes, and assignments.

Coding Platform App: Includes coding tracks, code editor with real-time execution, progress tracking, and leaderboards.

Placement Tools: A dedicated module offering curated links to job portals, mock interview sites, and resume builders.

Each role (student, faculty, admin) sees a tailored dashboard and navigation experience. The application uses Bootstrap for responsive design and includes minimal animations and transitions for smooth UX.
